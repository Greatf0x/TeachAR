# TeachAR
TeachAR is a real-time, AI-powered gesture recognition system that enables users to draw, erase, move objects, and control presentation slides using only hand gestures captured through a webcam. Built with MediaPipe, OpenCV, and a KNN-based gesture classifier, TeachAR delivers an AR-like teaching experience without requiring specialized hardware.
